# My Assessment Projects

This repository contains all my completed assessment projects:

1. **OrderStatsApp** - A React app displaying an order stats widget.
2. **CourseApp** - A React app displaying a responsive course table.
3. **Calc** - A Node.js CLI program that performs simple arithmetic calculations.
4. **Responsive Home Screen** - An HTML/SCSS program for a responsive home screen.
5. **TransactionsApp** - A React app displaying a responsive list of transactions.

Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` explaining how to set up and run the project.
