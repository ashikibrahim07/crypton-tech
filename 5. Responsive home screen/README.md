# Responsive Home Screen

The **Responsive Home Screen** project is a static web page built with **HTML** and **SCSS** that showcases a modern, mobile-first home screen design. This project emphasizes responsive design principles, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors.

- **A Web Browser**: Google Chrome, Firefox, or any modern browser to view the responsive home screen.
- **SCSS**: If you want to make any modifications to styles, ensure you have an SCSS compiler to convert SCSS into CSS (e.g., [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)).
